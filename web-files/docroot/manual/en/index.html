<h2>Searching in BISIS - User Manual</h2>

<p>The BISIS Retrieval home page displays a menu for choosing the retrieval method
(see Figure 1). The retrieval of records may be performed by using one or multiple
search prefixes. If using a single prefix, searching may be performed <i>by author</i>,
<i>by title</i>, and <i>by keywords</i>. Searching on multiple prefixes with logic
operators is invoked by clicking <i>advanced search</i>. The language of the
application may be selected by clicking <i>Srpski, Magyar, Slovenský, Română, Pyски, 
English</i>. This manual is opened by clicking the <i>Help</i> link.</p>

<h3>1. Searching By Author</h3>

<p>This section describes searching the BISIS database by author. Equivalent instructions
apply for searching <i>by title</i> and <i>by keywords</i>.</p>

<p>Clicking on <i>by author</i>, displays a search form with a text field for the name
of the author being searched for (see Figure 2). Clicking the <i>Submit</i> button will
send the query and display the report on the number of bibliographic records matching the
query (see Figure 3). Clicking the <i>Show results</i> button will display the matching
records (see Figure 4).</p>

</center>

<p>Browsing the retrieved records is performed in the following three modes: <i>brief</i>,
<i>detailed</i>, and <i>full display</i>. The brief display presents only the basic
elements of bibliographic records. Detailed display presents a broader set of record data,
while the full display presents the whole bibliographic record in UNIMARC format. Choosing
the display mode is performed by clicking the <i>Brief</i>, <i>Detailed</i>, and <i>Full
display</i> buttons, respectively. Figures 4-6 illustrate the three display modes presenting
the same record set.</p>

</center>

<p>Each display mode presents records in pages of 5, 10, or 20 records per page (as chosen
by the user). Moving across pages is invoked by clicking the <i>Previous</i> and <i>Next</i>
buttons. Return to the home page for entering a new query is invoked by clicking the
<i>New query</i> button.</p>

<p>Remark 1: BISIS retrieval treats cyrillic and latin letters equivalently, as used in the
Serbian laguage. For example, the following queries by author return the same result:
andrić, andric, андрић, анdрiћ, and so on.</p>

<p>Remark 2: The search query may contain wildcard characters, namely * and ?. An asterisk
(*) replaces a sequence of characters in a single word, while the question mark (?)
replaces a single character in a single word.</p>

<h3>2. Advanced Search</h3> 

<p>Clicking the <i>advanced search</i> link on the home page (Figure 1) will display the
query form for custom queries that enables combining multiple search criteria, as
presented in Figure 7.</p>

<p>Combining multiple search criteria is made using the logic operators AND, NOT and OR.</p>

<h4>Semantics of the logic operators</h4>

<p>Let the contents of one prefix be Text1 and the other one Text2. Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operator <i>AND</i> in the query Text1 AND Text2 combines the query elements in
such a way that it extracts only records that contain the first content (Text1) and
the second content (Text2) at the same time.</li>
<li>Operator <i>NOT</i> in the query Text1 NOT Text2 combines the query elements in
such a way that it extracts only records that contain the first content (Text1) and
do not contain the second content (Text2) at the same time.</li>
<li>Operator <i>OR</i> in the query Text1 OR Text2 combines the query elements in
such a way that it extracts records that contain any of the first content (Text1),
the second content (Text2), or both contents.</li>
</ol>

<center><img src="pic07.png"><br>
Figure 7.
</center>

<p>The form for advanced search provides for combining five different prefixes at most.
Choosing a search prefix is done by selecting the appropriate item in the combo box
at the left-hand side. The content searched for is entered in the corresponding text
field. Combining with other query elements is governed by the logic operator chosen
in the combo box at the right hand side of the line that contains the given search term.
If a text field is empty, the corresponding query element is ignored.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Figure 7 presents an example query that retrieves records conforming to the following 
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>the author is Ivo Andrić (combo box in the first row selects the prefix <i>Author</i>, 
while the text field in the first row contains <i>ivo andrić</i>),</li>
<li>the title of the record is not “Na Drini ćuprija” (the combo box with logic operators
in the previous row selects <i>NOT</i>, the prefix <i>Tile</i> in the current row is selected,
and the text field in the current row contains <i>na drini ćuprija</i>),</li>
<li>the language of the record is Serbian, using cyrillic alphabet (prefix selection combo
box in the fifth row selects <i>Language</i>, the text field in the same row contains <i>scc</i> 
(the code for the language), and the operator combo box in the last previous non-empty row - the
second row - selects <i>AND</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us go through the process of entering this query step by step.
The first query part searches by author. The search prefix denoting the author is
<i>Author</i> and is chosen in the first combo box, as presented in Figure 8.</p>

<center><img src="pic08.png"><br>
Figure 8.
</center>

<p>The corresponding text field, placed in the same row as the selected prefix author <i>Autor</i>, 
should contain the name of the author being searched for. In this example it is Ivo Andrić, 
as presented in Figure 9.</p>

<center><img src="pic09.png"><br>
Figure 9.
</center>

<p>The next part of the query is the requirement that retrieved records <b>do not</b>
contain the text <i>Na Drini ćuprija</i> as the title. The negation is represented by
the NOT operator, that is chosen in the right-hand-side combo box placed in the row where
the previous prefix is defined (the first row in this case), as presented in Figure 10.</p>

<center><img src="pic10.png"><br>
Figure 10.
</center>

<p>The next prefix may be placed in any of the following rows. The example presented in
Figure 11 uses the second row.</p>

<center><img src="pic11.png"><br>
Figure 11.
</center>

<p>The contents of the <i>Title</i> prefix are entered in the text field placed in the
second row of the query form, as presented in Figure 12.</p>

<center><img src="pic12.png"><br>
Figure 12.
</center>

<p>The third query segment deals with the language of the bibliographic unit - the
example requires it to be the Serbian language, using cyrillic alphabet. The operator
connecting this segment with the previous elements is AND, and it is selected in the
combo box placed in the last non-empty row (the second row in this example), as
presented in Figure 13.</p>

<center><img src="pic13.png"><br>
Figure 13.
</center>

<p>Choosing the prefix <i>Language</i>, denoting the language of the bibliographic 
material, may be done in any of the rows after the last row used. This example uses
the last row, as presented in Figure 14.</p>

<center><img src="pic14.png"><br>
Figure 14.
</center>

<p>Query formulation is finished by entering the contents of the last prefix. In this
example, the content is <i>scc</i>, entered in the text field placed in the same row as
the row of the selected prefix (the fifth row in this example), as presented in Figure 
15.</p>

<center><img src="pic15.png"><br>
Figure 15.
</center>

<p>Upon formulation, the query is submitted by clicking the <i>Submit</i> button.
The report on the number of retrieved records, and the display of the records in
brief, detailed and full mode is performed in the same manner as for other types
of queries (see Section 1, Search By Author).</p>

<p>Koristeći raspoložive prefikse i logičke operatore moguće je formirati
složene upite analogno prethodnom primeru. Pretraživanje po izabranim prefiksima
omogućava korisniku formiranje upita kojima se precizno mogu izdvojiti traženi
podaci. Za ilistraciju ovde je navedeno nekoliko upita.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Retrieve records authored by <i>Ivo Andrić</i>, and the title <b>is not</b>
<i>Na Drini ćuprija</i>, and the language of material is Serbian, using cyrillic alphabet.
The query looks like this:<p>

<center><img src="pic16.png"><br>
<!-- Figure 16. -->
</center>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Retrieve records authored by <i>Ivo Andrić</i> <b>or</b>
<i>Petar Džadžić</i>, and the title contains text <i>Na Drini ćuprija</i>.
The query looks like this:</p>

<center><img src="pic17.png"><br>
<!-- Figure 17. -->
</center>

<h4>Example 4</h4>

<p>Retrieve records authored by <i>Ivo Andrić</i> <b>and</b> the title
contains <i>Na Drini ćuprija</i> <b>or</b> <i>Znakovi pored puta</i>. The query
looks like this:</p>
